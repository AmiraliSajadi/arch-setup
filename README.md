# Version 2
In this version I'm trying to have a simpler and more robust setup.

## To Do:
- Secure Boot
- Snapper
- Alt + Tab (improve the existing rofi version)
- Auto Login (no need to login or use a display manager since we decrypting the entire disk on boot up)
- Idle (dim the screen etc.)
- Wallpaper (We will cache the wallpaper and have pywal and hyprlock work with the cached image)
- swaync Notification (its trying to import pywal colors and fails)
- Lock Screen
- Edge
- NeoVim (The config needs an update)
- installation scripts (WIP)


## Done:
- Rofi
- Power Menu


## Upgrades:

These are not necessary but will make nice additions.

- Grub customization
- Waybar arch icon --> power menu / rofi
- Manage and unify all the fonts in the system (a font software with gui?)
